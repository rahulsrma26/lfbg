# Linear Frame Buffer Graphics (lfbg)

A tiny library (based of [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)) for my old DOS graphics codes.

It's a cross-platform library. Tested on Windows 10, MacOS High Sierra and Ubuntu 18.04.
It may require xorg-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev packages on Ubuntu and other distributions based on Debian GNU/Linux. See, [glfw compile dependencies](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.1/compile.html#compile_deps_x11).
